WETHERPY


In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
Your objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

•	Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
•	Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
•	Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
•	Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


Your final notebook must:
•	Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
•	Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
•	Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
•	Save both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.


VACATIONPY


Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city generated from Part I - WeatherPy.

Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition:

A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.
Wind speed less than 10 mph.
Zero cloudiness.

Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.


Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country.ter notebook.
•	You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
•	You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
•	You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
